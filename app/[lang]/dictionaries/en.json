    "storyp1": "Yetarik Adera, a local aid organization, was established in December 2014 E.C. in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The organization was founded by 12 board members, and it has now been two years since it began its work.",
    "storyp2": "The main purpose of this aid organization is to ensure that the history of individuals who served their country during the time of Emperor Haile Selassie—in various fields with knowledge and responsibility—is truthfully documented. It was created with the intention of making sure these individuals are not forgotten by history.",
    "storyp3": "Yetarik Adera is actively collecting historical photographs, memoirs, and documents belonging to these individuals and is working to organize and share this history in an educational and museum-quality manner. In addition, it supports individuals and organizations that wish to write about these histories by providing documentation and access to personal archives in a collaborative and supportive way.",
    "storyp4": "It is widely known and accepted that Emperor Haile Selassie’s era played a foundational role in shaping modern Ethiopia. Through the expansion of education, the development of banking services, air transport, roads, and railway lines, that period significantly contributed to the building of Ethiopia through knowledge and labor. Therefore, this organization was founded to preserve and pass on that historic era to future generations.",
    "missionheading": "Mission",
    "missionStory": "To honor the legacy and sacrifice of the Imperial Ethiopian government officials who perished at the hands of the Derg, and their colleagues who served in the administration of Emperor Haile Selassie I.",

   "vision4": "Support",
    "vision4note": "Support relevant scholarly and creative works pertaining to this period by providing funding for scholarships, research, books and films.",
    "storyp5": "To realize this goal truthfully, Yetarik Adera is committed to documenting their stories both orally and in writing, encouraging a deeper understanding of history, and integrating it into educational institutions. It works with the government to ensure that history becomes a part of the curriculum in schools and at the university level, helping future generations learn about the tragic and unjust mass executions—carried out in a single day and night without trial—of our fathers, relatives, and fellow citizens. The aim is to prevent such atrocities from ever happening again.",
    "storyp6": "As we remember those who were killed 50 years ago—some of whom were our fathers, brothers, and relatives—we do so not only with grief, but with pride in the sacrifice and service they gave to their country. As their children and descendants, we recognize the bravery and struggle they undertook to prepare our nation for the 21st century. We rise to honor their names and ensure their memory is never erased. In doing so, we fulfill our historical responsibility through Yetarik Adera."
